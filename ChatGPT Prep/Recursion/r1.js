// Problem 1:
// Write a recursive function to calculate the factorial of a given positive integer.

// Problem 2:
// Write a recursive function to find the nth Fibonacci number, given an input n. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows: the first two numbers are 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

// Problem 3:
// Write a recursive function to determine if a given string is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

// Problem 4:
// Write a recursive function to calculate the sum of all elements in an array of integers.

// Problem 5:
// Write a recursive function to find the maximum value in an array of integers.

// Problem 6:
// Write a recursive function to find all possible permutations of a given string. The permutations should not contain any duplicates.

// Problem 7:
// Write a recursive function to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem. Given three towers (source, destination, and auxiliary) and a stack of n disks, the function should print the necessary steps to move all disks from the source tower to the destination tower, obeying the rules of the Tower of Hanoi puzzle.
