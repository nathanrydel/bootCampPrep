/* Declare a function 'findPair', which takes in an array of distinct numbers and a callback as arguments, and returns another function. The returned function should take in no arguments and when invoked, should find the next pair of numbers with the maximum sum when passing each to the callback and return them as an array of length two. If there's no pair left, all subsequent calls should return "No valid pairs left!".
