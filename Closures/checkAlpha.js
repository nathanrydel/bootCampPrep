/*Declare a function 'checkAlphabeticalOrder' which takes in no arguments and returns another function. The returned function should take in a single argument (it can be a string or -1) and when invoked with -1, it should check if all passed-in strings is in alphabetical order. If so, return "Great! The strings you entered are in alphabetical order", otherwise, return an array of strings containing segments in alphabetical order.
